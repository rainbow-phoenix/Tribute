    <h1>Lore</h1>
      <p class="lore">Lunar Princess Ranni, a champion of the Golden Order and an Empyrean, which meant she had the potential to succeed Queen Marika and one day rule over the Lands Between.
        She was the daughter of Radagon and Queen Renala, head of the Carian Royal Family of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Ranni was chosen by the Two Fingers to be raised as a potential ruler
        after Queen Marika and was thus given a Shadow to be raised alongside her and ensure her loyalty to the Golden Order.
      </p>

      <p class="lore">Despite being a canadidate to succeed Marika, however, Ranni despised the Greater Will and instead chose to forsake her title as an Empyrean and go against the ideals of the Golden Order.
        In order to be free of her Empyrean fate, she stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, which was needed in a plot to assassinate two certain individuals, her half-brother Godwyn and herself.
        This assassination came to be known as the Night of Black Knives, in which the Numen assassins(instructed by Ranni) murded Godwyn in spirit, while ranni killed her physical body and transferred her
        spirit into a doll. Some time after the Knight of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring and although Ranni claimed a Great Rune, she avoided the conflict that arose while pursing her dream
        of ridding the world of the influence of the Greater Will.
      </p>

      <p class="lore">Long after the time of the Shattering, the Tarnished begin to return to the Lands Between and Ranni approaches a certain Tarnished champion(Player) who has received a spectral steed given by Melina. Ranni
        gives this Tarnished the Sprit Callin Bell, explaining that Torrent's former master wished for Torrent's next owner to recieve it. Along the Player's journey, they can make their way towards the Carian Manor
        and encounter Ranni again. Once, she accepts the player into her service, she sends them on various quests that bring them to Nokron, the Eternal City, where they find a weapon capable of killing the Two Fingers.
        Along the quest the Tarnished finds a ring and if given to Ranni, she will accept you as her new consort and reveal her true plans, that is to succeed Queen Marika and usher in the "Age of the Dark Moon" thus
        giving the inhabitants of the Lands Between their own Free Will.
